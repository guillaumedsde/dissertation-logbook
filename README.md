# Level 4 dissertation logbook

This repository contains the source code for the HUGO statically generated website built with the theme [Beyond Nothing](https://themes.gohugo.io/beyondnothing/). I use it as a logbook for my level 4 dissertation project. This is where I take notes as my project progresses, the website is auto generated and [published](https://dissertation.guillaume.desusanne.com) to gitlab pages with [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/visualising-sensitivity-classification-features/logbook/pipelines) on each code change.

Development (issues, boards, CI, Docker respositories...) happens on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/visualising-sensitivity-classification-features/logbook) and a mirror (source code only, no issues etc...) of this repository is available on [github.com](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/dissertation-logbook).
