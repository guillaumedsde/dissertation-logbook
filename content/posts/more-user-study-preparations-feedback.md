## Feedback demo

I gave a demo of the application which resulted in very interesting feedback on the UI, the classifier, and sensitivity redaction as a whole.
The notes I took during this demo are [available here](https://harpocrates-app.gitlab.io/notech/meetings.md.html#special-ui-feedback-meeting)

## Targeted classifier

Part of the discussion during the demo was around targeted classifiers, in my case, the suggestion came up during a prior meeting: lets try and run the classifier on documents containing particular FOI section redactions. I will try and do that to build a "FOI Section 27 classifier".
