Over the course of this week, I have managed to implement a couple of features:

- Proper component UI for list of document sets and documents
- delete documents delete documents sets
- document Set metadata (size and document count)
- loading animations for document and documents set list
- properly reload document and document set list when a change happens (new element or delete element)
- gradual highlighting opacity for document feature depending on their importance
- preserve formatting of text document (respect line returns, align text on right)
- improve speed of document classification and explanation
- independently toggle "positive" explanations and "negative" explanations

As detailed in {{< ref "posts/shap-explainer.md" >}} I have not managed to implement a second explainer, the SHAP explainer.

I have spent some time trying to get the upload of an entire document set at once to work but have not managed to implement it. It could be that the OpenAPI code generator for the javascript client is buggy because `multipart/form-data` from the Javascript client does not put the correct form-data parameters, it could also well be that I am missing something in the [OpenAPI file upload documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/file-upload/) that is a bit light. I could try and implement my own document upload function, but before doing that I will try and find another codebase that uses a similar stack (namely OpenAPI and its autogenerated javscript API client).
